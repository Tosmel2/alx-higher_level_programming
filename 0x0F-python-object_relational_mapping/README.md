Projects to introduce SQL Alchemy in Python
All non-model scripts take at minimum in order mysql username, mysql password, and database name. Any extra arguments come after those three.

Using MYSQLDB
0-select_states.py: select states from database
1-filer_states.py: select states starting with N
2-my_filter_states.py: filter states with user input via argument to script
3-my_filter_states.py: filter states inject safe
4-cities_by_states.py: list all cities ordered by city id
5-filter_cities.py: list all cities in a state sorted by city id

Using SQLAlchemy
model_state.py: ORM model for a state using SQLAlchemy
7-model_state_fetch_all.py: get all states
8-model_state_fetch_first.py: get first state in table
9-model_state_filter_a.py: get states with lowercase 'a' in their name
10-model_state_my_get.py: get state with name pass as argument to script
11-model_state_insert.py: insert "Louisiana" into the states table
12-model_state_insert.py: change name of state with id=2 to New Mexico
13-model_state_delete_a.py: delete all states with lowercase 'a' in their name
model_city.py: ORM model for city
14-model_city_fetch_by_state: List all cities along with their state's name
